Shallow and deep copies are two ways of creating copies of objects.

Shallow copy creates a new object but copies only the outermost structure, the nested objects are shared between original and shallow copy. Changes made in nested copy with affect both. Implemented using object.copy().

Deep copy, on the other hand, creates a new object and recursively copies all nested objects producing a fully independent duplicate. Changes to deep copy does not affect the orginal object. Implemented using object.deepcopy().

Shallow copy to be used when:
1. Your object is flat and contains only immutable elements.
2. You want a quick and efficient copy without duplicating nested structures.
3. You are okay with shared reference to nested objects.

Deep copy to be used when:
1. Your object has nested mutable structures.
2. You require complete isolation between orignal and copy.
3. You don't want shared reference.

Shallow copy uses less memory and faster in computation.
